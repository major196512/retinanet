Pytorch  implementation of RetinaNet object detection as described in [Focal Loss for Dense Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002) by Tsung-Yi Lin, Priya Goyal, Ross Girshick, Kaiming He and Piotr Doll√°r.

This implementation is a slightly twisted version of [this repo](https://github.com/yhenon/pytorch-retinanet), just for personal use.
Please refer to the original repository for further implementations.
